Django Obit
===========

This Django app is in major flux, but its aim is allow area funeral homes 
to supply a given local newspaper with clean, reliable death notice and 
obituary information that can be quickly and easily formatted and distributed 
both online and in print. A few Adobe InDesign templates are included as 
examples.
